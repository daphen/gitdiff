# Test Conflicts

This directory contains example files with merge conflicts for testing the GitDiff plugin.

## How to use these files

1. Copy these files to your git repository
2. Open Neovim and run the GitDiff plugin
3. Practice resolving the conflicts using the plugin interface

## Files included

- `example1.js`: JavaScript file with function implementation conflicts
- `example2.py`: Python file with multiple method conflicts
- `example3.md`: Markdown file with documentation conflicts

## Testing scenarios

These files allow you to test:

- Choosing "our" changes (use key '1' or 'o')
- Choosing "their" changes (use key '2' or 't')
- Combining both changes (use key '3' or 'b')
- Navigating between files (use Ctrl+j and Ctrl+k)
- Navigating between conflict chunks (use j and k)

## Notes

After resolving all conflicts in a file, the plugin will automatically stage the file.
When all conflicts are resolved, the plugin will notify you that you can commit the changes.
